Alpha
======

Alpha is an Arduino-compatible display that includes five ultra-bright 18-segment alphanumeric displays. It's powered by USB or external supply, and can be daisy-chained. It's also internet-enabled with the inclusion of a Wifi-enabled Spark Core.

I was inspired to build the Alpha by Windell Oskay's [Alpha Clock Five](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/589). I loved the giant, bright LED displays, so I purchased some when I lived in China and started experimenting. The Alpha is the result of those experiments. I found that my Alpha prototypes were always sitting at my desk, powered by USB, and that I liked being able to use them for notifications or other data. I added a microcontroller with native USB (based on the Atmega32u4/Arduino Leonardo), a boost converter to run the white LEDs off of USB power, as well as the option to use a Spark Core for a wireless display.
